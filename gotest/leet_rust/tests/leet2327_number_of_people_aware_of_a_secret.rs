// On day 1, one person discovers a secret.
// You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new
// person every day, starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an
// integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering
// it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.
// Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since
// the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.
// Example 1:
//   Input: n = 6, delay = 2, forget = 4
//   Output: 5
//   Explanation:
//     Day 1: Suppose the first person is named A. (1 person)
//     Day 2: A is the only person who knows the secret. (1 person)
//     Day 3: A shares the secret with a new person, B. (2 people)
//     Day 4: A shares the secret with a new person, C. (3 people)
//     Day 5: A forgets the secret, and B shares the secret with a new person, D. (3 people)
//     Day 6: B shares the secret with E, and C shares the secret with F. (5 people)
// Example 2:
//   Input: n = 4, delay = 1, forget = 3
//   Output: 6
//   Explanation:
//     Day 1: The first person is named A. (1 person)
//     Day 2: A shares the secret with B. (2 people)
//     Day 3: A and B share the secret with 2 new people, C and D. (4 people)
//     Day 4: A forgets the secret. B, C, and D share the secret with 3 new people. (6 people)
// Constraints:
//   2 <= n <= 1000
//   1 <= delay < forget <= n
