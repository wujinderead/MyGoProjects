// https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/

// A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit
// there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone,
// but it must not jump into the water. Given a list of stones' positions (in units)
// in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by
// landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume
// the first jump must be 1 unit.
// If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either
// k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
// Note:
//   The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
//   Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 2^31.
//   The first stone's position is always 0.
// Example 1:
//   Input: [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
//   Output: true
//   Explanation:
//     There are a total of 8 stones. The first stone at the 0th unit,
//     second stone at the 1st unit, third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
//     The last stone at the 17th unit. The frog can jump to the last stone by
//     jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone,
//     then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,
//     4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
// Example 2:
//   Input: [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
//   Output: false
//   Explanation:
//     There is no way to jump to the last stone as
//     the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
