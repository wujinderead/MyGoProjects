// https://leetcode.com/problems/plates-between-candles/

// There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given
// a 0-indexed string s consisting of characters '*' and '|' only, where a '*' represents a plate
// and a '|' represents a candle.
// You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti] denotes
// the substring s[lefti...righti] (inclusive). For each query, you need to find the number of plates
// between candles that are in the substring. A plate is considered between candles if there is at
// least one candle to its left and at least one candle to its right in the substring.
// For example, s = "||**||**|*", and a query [3, 8] denotes the substring "*||**|". The number of plates
// between candles in this substring is 2, as each of the two plates has at least one candle in the
// substring to its left and right.
// Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith queryã€‚
// Example 1:
//   Input: s = "**|**|***|", queries = [[2,5],[5,9]]
//   Output: [2,3]
//   Explanation:
//   - queries[0] has two plates between candles.
//   - queries[1] has three plates between candles.
// Example 2:
//   Input: s = "***|**|*****|**||**|*", queries = [[1,17],[4,5],[14,17],[5,11],[15,16]]
//   Output: [9,0,0,0,0]
//   Explanation:
//     - queries[0] has nine plates between candles.
//     - The other queries have zero plates between candles.
// Constraints:
//   3 <= s.length <= 10^5
//   s consists of '*' and '|' characters.
//   1 <= queries.length <= 105
//   queries[i].length == 2
//   0 <= lefti <= righti < s.length
